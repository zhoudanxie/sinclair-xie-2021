      " Based on documents and communications with the federal safety regulators, the complaint cited a number of cases in which it contended that recalls for a documented safety problem were limited or late, or warranty claims were ignored -- as with recalls for axle shafts that could break and a defect in a shift cable that could cause cars to roll out of park and crash. That report was sharply critical of G.M.'s culture and described instances in which the company's engineers, product developers and legal department overlooked or failed to act on safety concerns. The complaint used a previously disclosed email to Ms. Barra to suggest the company's knowledge of safety problems stretched to the highest levels. \" ['federal safety'] [3] [3] -14.285714285714285 \n",

      " It's the worst year for auto recalls in U.S. history, with more than one in five cars and trucks at risk of sometimes critical, deadly defects. After landmark cases against General Motors and Toyota, automakers are running scared, and some are sounding the alarm over problems that may have once gone ignored. The Takata recall list that safety regulators shared Monday was drastically incomplete: The number of defective vehicles has grown by more than 3 million in the days since, and some cars initially recalled were not defective, after all. Government Web sites with information on the recalls, including a site drivers could use to look up whether their vehicle had problems (www.safercar.gov/vinlookup), were down all Tuesday in the hours after news of the massive air-bag recall had spread, and remained down Wednesday morning. \" But car companies say there is a short supply of parts needed to fix those defects, and safety regulators can not even agree on how many vehicles have the dangerous flaws. Federal regulators this week urged the owners of 7.8 million Hondas, Toyotas, BMWs and other vehicles to \"take immediate action\" on a recall for malfunctioning air bags that blast out metal shards. The defect, tied to Japanese auto parts manufacturer Takata, has been linked to at least two deaths and dozens of injuries. Regulators have also struggled with even the basic elements of a recall. The mess of confusing, contradictory information can often cause car owners to give up and ignore the problem. But the disjointed recall system patched together by automakers and regulators is leaving millions of broken vehicles still on the road. Those faulty cars and trucks have joined 50 million others recalled nationwide so far this year, more than three times the number of vehicles sold across the country in 2013.

      " The inspector general stopped short of saying the New York Fed could have stopped the London whale trades before they contributed to such big losses, saying it can be difficult for examiners to detect problems at banks before they emerge. \" In 2012, J.P. Morgan announced losses in the unit related to botched derivatives trades that eventually cost the bank $6 billion. Regulators weren't the only ones who ignored warning signs about the losses. The bank stopped sending key reports to the OCC, and the regulator \"tolerated bank reports that omitted portfolio-specific performance data,\" the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said in March 2013. The OCC, which oversees J.P. Morgan's main banking subsidiary, was taken to task by Senate investigators in 2013 for failing to notice warning signs about the whale trades -- so named for a J.P. Morgan employee in London who built up the giant positions. A Senate report in 2013 found that J.P. Morgan also brushed off warnings of mounting risk in the investment unit and misled regulators and investors about the scope of losses from the trades. --- Fed examiners also failed to tell another regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, of its desire for a deeper look at the J.P. Morgan unit in 2009 -- despite prior agreements between the agencies to work together, the inspector general said. The Fed's Office of Inspector General on Tuesday released a four-page summary of a yearslong investigation, saying Fed supervisors didn't follow up on signs that the bank's chief investment office -- where the traders engaging in the problematic derivatives transactions were based -- needed a closer look. The New York Fed, in particular, already is on the defensive after the recent disclosure of a 2009 internal report finding that its supervisors were too reluctant to criticize Wall Street, hindering its ability to spot and eradicate problems. The Fed also now has an internal system for tracking progress on issues that its examiners raise. The inspector general found that the New York Fed's planned exam never went off \"due to many supervisory demands and a lack of supervisory resources,\" weaknesses in planning procedures, and the loss of \"institutional knowledge\" after a 2011 reorganization of the team supervising J.P. Morgan, according to the report. Emily Glazer contributed to this article. A team of experts from across the Fed system recommended the New York Fed conduct \"a full-scope examination\" of the J.P. Morgan unit in 2009, but the regulator never did, the report said. The report is the latest black eye for regulators, who continue to be criticized for failing to spot -- and prevent -- problems at financial institutions even after the financial crisis showed a lack of regulatory oversight.

      " The regulator reported only two confirmed cases of deaths from air bag deployment in 2007, and one in 2008. Auto makers are scrambling to notify owners and secure enough parts to complete the recall. Regulators this year recalled 2.6 million General Motors Co. vehicles after determining a faulty ignition switch could inadvertently power off vehicles, shutting down the air bags and other safety systems. Air bags aren't designed to deploy in all crashes. That is down from an average of nearly 20 fatalities a year in the 1990s, peaking at 52 in 1997. Air bags can also fail to deploy when they are supposed to. In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the chief auto safety regulator in the U.S., said that air-bag-related fatalities had reached \"near zero\" levels. An announcement by U.S. auto safety regulators this week urging millions of car owners to take \"immediate action\" to repair defective Takata Corp. air bags comes after years of declining incidents of air bag explosions and accidental deployments. U.S. auto regulators say more than 7 million vehicles have been affected by Takata's global air bag defect, which is responsible for at least two deaths and several injuries. Advances in air bag technology in the past decade have sharply reduced the risk of air bag injuries among children and small adults.

But in this case, people briefed on the matter said, prosecutors are likely to temporarily defer to federal safety regulators when it comes to the more pressing task of getting the airbags off the road. The first recall for the airbags was issued by Honda in 2008, for about 4,200 vehicles. \" WASHINGTON -- Reviving an inquiry that it had once started but then quickly closed, the nation's auto safety regulator ordered the airbag supplier Takata to turn over documents and answer under oath questions related to defective airbag inflaters. At least three deaths and more than 30 injuries have been attributed to the defect, which can cause airbags to rupture, sending metal shards at people in the car. The order, by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, demanded that Takata turn over records regarding the production, testing and subsequent concerns raised internally and by automakers over the airbags, as well as communications between the company and automakers about defect concerns. Takata was alerted to the problem as early as 2004, when the airbag in a 2002 Honda Accord ruptured in Alabama, but neither Takata nor Honda told regulators, a New York Times investigation has shown. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have also taken an interest in the Takata defects, as they did after recalls by Toyota and General Motors.

Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said they were concerned that the agency allowed automakers to recall vehicles with the defective Takata airbags only in two states and two territories that it said had high humidity, in what is known as a regional recall. It is not known whether he is being considered for the top, permanent position. More than 14 million cars have been recalled worldwide by Honda and 10 other automakers for the rupture hazard, including 11 million in the United States. The investigation found that in many prominent vehicle safety issues of recent years -- including the ruptures of airbags made by Takata -- the agency did not act more forcefully until the problems had reached a crisis level and motorists were injured or had died. Both lead committees that have held aggressive hearings on G.M.'s deadly ignition switch defect and the regulator's role in overseeing the auto industry. The inquiry into the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration comes during a record year for recalls, in which the agency's role in analyzing crash data and policing vehicle defects has been scrutinized by Congress.

      " We want to make sure that everyone out there -- and we've got millions of vehicles involved -- is getting engaged and is getting their vehicles fixed to protect themselves and their families,\" said David J. Friedman, deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A New York Times investigation in September revealed that Honda and Takata had failed for years to take decisive action before issuing the recalls. Takata did not immediately respond when asked how long it would take to provide replacement air bags. Honda reached a confidential settlement with Mr. Rodriguez last year, but does not appear to have filed a report on the case with regulators. Honda said that it had started a third-party audit of \"potential inaccuracies in its reporting.\" Complaints received by regulators about various automakers blamed Takata air bags for at least 139 injuries, including 37 people who reported air bags that exploded, the investigation showed. And problems persist with Honda's reporting of potential defects. In at least four more recent suspected ruptures, including the one linked to Mr. Xu's death, Honda has not filed a so-called early warning report with safety regulators, as is required in cases where there is a claim of defect that resulted in an injury or death, according to case lawyers and legal filings. The auto industry is facing a safety crisis, spurred by revelations that General Motors failed for years to disclose a defective ignition switch that it has linked to at least 29 deaths. Air bags, particularly those made by Takata, have been one of the biggest and longest-simmering problems. In September 2011, Eddie Rodriguez crashed his Honda Civic in Puerto Rico, deploying air bags that launched \"sharp pieces of metal\" toward him, causing extensive injuries, according to a lawsuit he filed against Honda the following year. When Ms. Tran crashed her car, the air bag, instead of protecting her, appeared to have exploded and sent shrapnel flying into her neck, the Orange County sheriff's office said. On Monday, in an unusual warning, federal safety regulators urged the owners of more than five million vehicles to \"act immediately\" to get the air bags fixed. \" Automakers, as well as federal regulators, have responded with increasing urgency, recalling more than 50 million vehicles in the United States this year, shattering the record of about 30 million in 2004.

      "1614391304 New York Fed Faulted in 'London Whale' Case; Regulator Failed to Examine J.P. Morgan Unit Ahead of Trading Losses, Watchdog Says : Wall Street Journal \n",
      " The Fed's Office of Inspector General on Tuesday released a four-page summary of a yearslong investigation, saying Fed supervisors didn't follow up on signs that the bank's chief investment office--where the traders engaging in the problematic derivatives transactions were based--needed a closer look. When Senate investigators probed the London whale in 2010, they focused on the OCC, which is the primary regulator of J.P. Morgan's banking unit, where the London whale trades were conducted. Fed examiners also failed to tell another regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, of its desire for a deeper look at the J.P. Morgan unit in 2009--despite prior agreements between the agencies to work together, the inspector general said. But many of those trades were booked in a J.P. Morgan subsidiary that was in the Fed's jurisdiction, the inspector general said, and the supervisors \"lacked a common understanding\" of their roles. The New York Fed, in particular, is already on the defensive after the recent disclosure of a 2009 internal report finding that its supervisors were too reluctant to criticize Wall Street, hindering its ability to spot and eradicate problems. In 2012, J.P. Morgan announced losses in the unit related to botched derivatives trades that eventually cost the bank $6 billion. But the inspector general's report shows a regulatory failure to detect the growing risks to a broader extent than previously known--one that came after the 2008 financial crisis prompted the government to reassess its ability to detect and fix such problems. The full version of the report, which examined the period between 2004 and 2012 and took more than two years to complete, was kept private to hide \"supervisory information that is privileged and confidential and is thus restricted from public distribution,\" the inspector general said. The inspector general found that the New York Fed's planned exam never went off \"due to many supervisory demands and a lack of supervisory resources,\" weaknesses in planning procedures, and the loss of \"institutional knowledge\" after a 2011 reorganization of the team supervising J.P. Morgan, according to the report. Instead, the inspector general released a four-page summary that included few details about what Fed examiners found when they were probing J.P. Morgan's operations and only a general description of what went wrong with the Fed's supervisory process. The letter was released by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. The bank stopped sending key reports to the OCC, and the regulator \"tolerated bank reports that omitted portfolio-specific performance data,\" the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said in March 2013. The OCC, which oversees J.P. Morgan's main banking subsidiary, was taken to task by Senate investigators in 2013 for failing to notice warning signs about the whale trades--so-named for a J.P. Morgan employee in London who built up the giant positions. A team of experts from across the Fed system recommended the New York Fed conduct \"a full-scope examination\" of the J.P. Morgan unit in 2009, but the regulator never did, the report said. The inspector general stopped short of saying the New York Fed could have stopped the London whale trades before they contributed to such big losses, saying it can be difficult for examiners to detect problems at banks before they emerge. \" Regulators weren't the only ones who ignored warning signs about the losses. Regulators have since taken J.P. Morgan to task for the trades, with the bank paying more than $1 billion to settle various claims about its management and oversight. A Senate report in 2013 found that J.P. Morgan also brushed off warnings of building risk in the investment unit and misled regulators and investors about the scope of losses from the trades. Emily Glazer contributed to this article. The Fed also now has an internal system for tracking progress on issues that its examiners raise. The report is the latest black eye for regulators, who continue to be criticized for failing to spot--and prevent--problems at financial institutions even after the financial crisis revealed a lack of regulatory oversight.

      " Some car makers plan to replace all the suspect air bags; others are offering replacements only for vehicles registered in hot and humid climates that have been associated with initial injury reports. Law makers and safety advocates are calling on the U.S. auto regulator, car makers and a major supplier of automotive air bags to agree to a nationwide recall of millions of vehicles equipped with air bags that can explode too violently. Calls for a coordinated action comes following differing approaches to dealing with the air bags by auto makers. NHTSA and The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry trade group, declined to comment. Takata supplied air bags to at least 7.8 million U.S. vehicles built by at least 10 manufacturers. NHTSA's warning marks the second large-scale government intervention in a year and came just months after GM recalled millions of vehicles because of an ignition-switch defect that killed 29 people based on current estimates. The panel is initiating contacts after federal regulators warned drivers of certain vehicles that their air bags could explode too forcefully. These cars may not technically be covered by NHTSA's action--but they are subject to the same Florida weather conditions and pose the same risk to Floridians traveling on the public roadways.\" The move comes as federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Japanese air bag supplier Takata Corp. made misleading statements to regulators about the safety of its air bags, people familiar with the matter said.

Some car makers say they plan to replace all the suspect air bags; others are offering replacements only for vehicles registered in hot and humid climates that have been associated with initial injury reports. More than three months ago, NHTSA allowed Takata and its auto maker customers to limit repair actions to several hot weather states and territories. That month Takata agreed to \"support\" regional \"field actions,\" according to a June 11 letter from the company to NHTSA officials, but \"neither Takata nor the vehicle manufacturers conducting these field actions would be expected to admit that its products contain\" a safety defect. Authorities originally believed her wounds were caused by an assault. The expansion of repairs first agreed upon in June by Takata triggered outrage on Wednesday from lawmakers and safety advocates. The plague of recalls also threatens to undermine confidence in the federal auto safety regulatory system at a time when industry executives are gearing up to persuade consumers to trust their lives to vehicles that can drive themselves. That is down from an average of nearly 20 fatalities a year in the 1990s, peaking at 52 in 1997. Corrections &amp; Amplifications About two-thirds of air-bag deaths in the 1990s were attributable to children riding in the front seat, a report by the chief U.S. auto-safety regulator said. WSJ October 25, 2014) A suddenly expanded recall of air bags is turning into a new safety crisis for the auto industry and intensifying scrutiny of U.S. regulators' ability to oversee auto makers and their suppliers. The agency responded with urgent warnings to owners of 7.8 million vehicles manufactured by 10 auto makers to \"act immediately\" to replace \"defective Takata air bags.\" General Motors Co. is also under investigation by the same office for its mishandling of ignition switches that failed and disabled air bags in accidents that GM has linked to 29 deaths. The regulator then reported only two confirmed cases of deaths from air bag deployment in 2007 and one in 2008. In the past, it has said that it is cooperating with regulators and car makers. Auto makers and regulators have known about problems with Takata air bags manufactured between 2000 and 2007 for several years. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is investigating whether air bag supplier Takata Corp. made misleading statements about the safety of its air bags to U.S. regulators, people familiar with the matter said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday issued a bulletin warning of defects in Takata air bags. Messrs. Upton and Blumenthal were among the leading congressional critics of the way GM and NHTSA officials responded to the Detroit auto giant's failure to act quickly on the ignition switch defects, and other problems that have led GM to recall more than 30 million vehicles this year. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, (R., Mich.), said there needs to be a close look at this air bag issue and the timeline and scope of the recalls to ensure that the appropriate steps are being taken to protect drivers and their families. Regulators this week nearly doubled their estimate of the number of U.S. vehicles affected, to 7.8 million, and said the figure could be revised again. The probe is at a preliminary stage and could end without any charges filed. They urged regulators to formally recall affected vehicles nationwide. A Page One article on Thursday about government scrutiny of U.S. air-bag recalls incorrectly said it was more than 90%. ( In June, the regulator's Office of Defect Investigation had found six total instances where an air bag had ruptured. The regulator also has said it learned earlier this month of new tests by Toyota Motor Corp. and Takata that heightened concern about the safety of vehicles in hot, humid states. A U.S. based Takata spokesman said he isn't aware of an investigation by federal prosecutors, but if there were one, Takata would cooperate fully. In 2010, the NHTSA said that air bag-related fatalities had reached \"near-zero\" levels.

Regulators pushed back, saying a nationwide recall would divert a limited supply of replacement air bags \"from those at demonstrated risk\" in areas with long-term humidity and heat. But in a letter to regulators last week, Markey and Blumenthal criticized the \"arbitrary geographic boundaries\" of automakers' \"puzzling and inconsistent\" recall. Honda said it \"has nearly completed the mailing of notifications regarding the special campaign,\" and Toyota, the largest carmaker in the world, said it has intensified efforts to reach customers \"in certain geographic areas that appear to warrant immediate action.\" Replacement parts are 'essential to personal safety' for all drivers whether they live in New England or Florida.\" ['air bag', 'motor vehicle', 'air bag', 'air bag', 'geographic boundary', 'geographic area', 'replacement part', 'personal safety'] [3, 3, 3, 5, 5] [3] -4.942965779467682 \n",

      "1615129425 Air Bag Recalls Trigger New Scrutiny; An Urgent Call for Repairs as Prosecutors Look at Past Statements : Wall Street Journal \n",
      " Mr. Upton's committee is contacting regulators and car manufacturers to discuss problems with suppliers. Some car makers say they plan to replace all the suspect air bags; others are offering replacements only for vehicles registered in hot and humid climates that have been associated with initial injury reports. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was more than 90%. ( More than three months ago, NHTSA allowed Takata and its auto maker customers to limit repair actions to several hot weather states and territories. That month Takata agreed to \"support\" regional \"field actions,\" according to a June 11 letter from the company to NHTSA officials, but \"neither Takata nor the vehicle manufacturers conducting these field actions would be expected to admit that its products contain\" a safety defect. Authorities originally believed her wounds were caused by an assault. The expansion of repairs first agreed upon in June by Takata triggered outrage on Wednesday from lawmakers and safety advocates. Corrections &amp; Amplifications A report by the chief U.S. auto safety regulator said about two-thirds of air bag deaths in the 1990s were attributable to children riding in the front seat. The plague of recalls also threatens to undermine confidence in the federal auto safety regulatory system at a time when industry executives are gearing up to persuade consumers to trust their lives to vehicles that can drive themselves. That is down from an average of nearly 20 fatalities a year in the 1990s, peaking at 52 in 1997. Mike Ramsey and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article. A U.S. based Takata spokesman said he isn't aware of an investigation by federal prosecutors, \"but if there were one, Takata would cooperate fully.\" The agency responded with urgent warnings to owners of 7.8 million vehicles manufactured by 10 auto makers to \"act immediately\" to replace \"defective Takata air bags.\" A suddenly expanded recall of air bags is turning into a new safety crisis for the auto industry and intensifying scrutiny of U.S. regulators' ability to oversee auto makers and their suppliers. General Motors Co. is also under investigation by the same office for its mishandling of ignition switches that failed and disabled air bags in accidents that GM has linked to 29 deaths. The regulator then reported only two confirmed cases of deaths from air bag deployment in 2007 and one in 2008. In the past, it has said that it is cooperating with regulators and car makers. Auto makers and regulators have known about problems with Takata air bags manufactured between 2000 and 2007 for several years. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is investigating whether air bag supplier Takata Corp. made misleading statements about the safety of its air bags to U.S. regulators, people familiar with the matter said. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday issued a bulletin warning of defects in Takata air bags. Messrs. Upton and Blumenthal were among the leading congressional critics of the way GM and NHTSA officials responded to the Detroit auto giant's failure to act quickly on the ignition switch defects, and other problems that have led GM to recall more than 30 million vehicles this year. Regulators this week nearly doubled their estimate of the number of U.S. vehicles affected, to 7.8 million, and said the figure could be revised again. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, (R., Mich.), said there needs to be a close look at this air bag issue and the timeline and scope of the recalls to ensure that the appropriate steps are being taken to protect drivers and their families. The probe is at a preliminary stage and could end without any charges filed. They urged regulators to formally recall affected vehicles nationwide. In June, the regulator's Office of Defect Investigation had found six total instances where an air bag had ruptured. The regulator also has said it learned earlier this month of new tests by Toyota Motor Corp. and Takata that heightened concern about the safety of vehicles in hot, humid states. In 2010, the NHTSA said that air bag-related fatalities had reached \"near-zero\" levels. The mostly older cars are equipped with air bags that could explode with too much force during a collision, spraying drivers and passengers with shrapnel, regulators have said.

      " The city is outraged that PG&amp;E's malfeasance extended to an attempt to manipulate decision making,\" San Bruno City Manager Connie Jackson said. -- One involved exchanges between Commissioner Michael Florio and former PG&amp;E Vice President Brian Cherry about gas pipeline pressure in the city of San Carlos. Many of these contacts involved a major rate-setting case and the 2010 explosion of a natural gas pipeline that killed eight people, injured 66 and destroyed 38 houses in the Bay Area city of San Bruno. Federal prosecutors in San Francisco have opened an investigation into controversial emails and other contacts between state regulators and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. California's largest utility said Monday that it was informed by the U.S. attorney's office that an investigation was underway into emails between the utility and the Public Utilities Commission that have come under fire in recent months. The contacts between the utility and the regulator, said Mayor Jim Ruane, were a major violation of PUC rules and flaunted legal principles by allowing one-sided private communications between the regulator and utility -- a party in many pending cases before the commission. The latest batch of emails disclosed Monday offer a more detailed look at the deep connection between the utility and regulators. Both San Bruno officials and ratepayer advocates scheduled news conferences outside PUC headquarters in San Francisco to demand that regulators and law enforcement agencies conduct in-depth investigations of about 65,000 emails covering five years that PG&amp;E said it had reviewed recently. \" The U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco did not respond to a request for comment.

All the emails submitted by PG&amp;E are expected to be reviewed during a hearing set for Tuesday before a Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge. They provide a glimpse into wide-ranging discussions that also include power plant projects, global warming, renewable energy, ballot measure campaign contributions and the 2010 explosion -- as commissioners discussed sensitive political and regulatory matters with utility officials.

      " The for-profit college industry soared during the Great Recession as schools marketed heavily to growing ranks of unemployed workers seeking new skills. Democratic members of Congress and student advocacy groups argued the rules were too weak. Amid investigations and new regulations, enrollments slowed and stock prices have plummeted. The announcement came after the Department of Education restricted access to federal student loans and grants and put the company on the brink of collapse. Some for-profit schools receive up to 90% of their revenue from federal loans and grants. The new Education Department rules apply to for-profit colleges and certificate programs at community colleges and private nonprofit schools. Duncan said the new rules, known as \"gainful employment\" regulations, are intended to weed out programs that rely heavily on taxpayer subsidies but don't follow through on promises of career training. The move by the Education Department is a second attempt at regulating career colleges, after a federal judge struck down an earlier version of the rules in 2012. U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who led a two-year investigation into the industry, argued that the current regulations focus only on graduates, letting schools with high dropout rates off the hook. \" Corinthian has been in the cross hairs of more than a dozen state and federal regulators for more than a year amid allegations that the company falsified student job placement rates and steered students into high-interest loans. That means that the earliest a program could be cut off from federal funding is late 2017. The regulations apply to each college's specific programs, such as criminal justice or nursing, meaning some could be disqualified while others remain eligible. In addition to the new rules, the department said it would create an interagency task force to regulate the industry, alongside agencies such as the Justice Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. An industry trade group successfully sued to halt the regulations, calling them arbitrary and unfair. Administration officials said the new policy would hold more programs accountable than the earlier version that was struck down. The department estimated that about 1,400 programs would fail the debt-to-income test, out of 5,500 covered by the regulations. The U.S. Department of Education's effort, unveiled Thursday, is the latest sign that federal and state authorities are ramping up scrutiny of the for-profit college industry, which includes major brands such as ITT Technical Institute, the University of Phoenix and Everest College, owned by the troubled Corinthian Colleges Inc., based in Orange County. This rule does nothing to stop schools from offering, and our most at-risk students from enrolling in, programs where most students fail and default,\" he said. -- The Education Department will judge schools by tracking their graduates' finances, using Social Security Administration data. The new regulations also require programs to prominently disclose information on graduation rates and loan debt to prospective students. The Obama administration is stepping up regulation of for-profit career colleges, announcing rules that could cut off federal funding to institutions that leave students with massive debts they can't repay. One of the largest corporations, Santa Ana-based Corinthian, said in July that it would sell the vast majority of its campuses. of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, called it a \"fundamentally flawed and misguided proposal.\" \" But the rapid growth attracted the attention of federal and state authorities, who noted poor graduation rates and ballooning student loan defaults at many of the schools. While the administration deserves praise for issuing a final rule despite relentless lobbying by the for-profit college industry, it can and must do much more to protect students and taxpayers from well-documented abuses,\" said Pauline Abernathy, vice president of the Institute for College Access &amp; Success, an Oakland group that focuses on student debt issues. The company has denied the allegations. For-profit schools enroll about 11% of all college students, but the sector is responsible for 44% of student loan defaults, according to federal data. The regulation will hurt the very students it is intended to help by restricting educational access for millions of students and unfairly targeting certain institutions,\" Steve Gunderson, the group's president and chief executive, said in a statement. While some are strong, today too many of these programs fail to provide the training [students] need, while burying them in debt they cannot repay.\" ['new regulation', 'student loan', 'department rule', 'certificate program', 'new rule', 'gainful employment', 'job placement', 'federal funding', 'criminal justice', 'new rule', 'task force', 'consumer financial protection bureau', 'u.s department', 'state authority', 'social security', 'new regulation', 'federal funding', 'state authority', 'student loan', 'final rule', 'student loan', 'certain institution'] [3, 3, 13, 1, 2, 8, 5, 13, 3, 1, 5, 2] [3] -3.8147138964577656 \n",

      " For foreign automobile makers, which increasingly have counted on consumers in the world's largest car market to offset weakness elsewhere, the slowdown in economic growth adds to pressures that include increased regulatory scrutiny. China's passenger-car sales last month rose 6.4% from a year earlier to about 1.7 million vehicles, according to data released on Monday by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, a government-backed industry group. Mr. Ye said that could affect the car association's sales figures because they measure wholesale deliveries to dealers, not retail figures. \" A number of foreign auto makers have faced scrutiny from antitrust regulators over their business practices with dealers as well as their pricing of spare parts and services. Ye Sheng, an analyst at market research firm Ipsos, said pressure from Beijing could be contributing to weakening sales.

      " While some frustrated passengers side with the congressman, others vehemently disagree that the government ought to get involved in regulating their points and miles. But in a letter to DOT Inspector General Calvin Scovel, he presented his arguments for tighter regulation. \" For example, a 2001 report on airlines' customer-service commitments contained recommendations to increase resources allocated to the DOT division responsible for consumer protection and a corresponding increase in the oversight and enforcement of regulations. Grayson didn't respond to requests for a comment on the audit. In response, Congress upped the agency's funding. And that could spell trouble for the future of unregulated and immensely profitable loyalty programs. New rules required airlines to develop customer service plans, contingencies and reporting requirements for long onboard delays. He notes that a DOT memo points out that the department has little power over the programs' rules but can mandate clearer disclosure of costs and program rule changes. \" But some say that his critique misses the biggest problem with these schemes. DOT inspector general audits can result in significant if not sweeping changes. Likewise, a 2007 report about onboard delays led to landmark tarmac delay regulations, which went into effect in 2010. I've even heard people refer to these programs as bait-and-switch scenarios.\" The congressman zeroed in on federal laws that seem to prohibit the kind of behavior airlines are engaging in, and correctly pointed out that the DOT has some authority to regulate them. A new survey by market research firm Colloquy reflects this deep division. Frequent flyer programs are prone to manipulation by the airlines that control them,\" he wrote, likening the estimated $700 billion worth of miles to an unregulated currency. \" We have seen over and again what happens to various industries when the government tries to get involved and issue mandates,\" says Charlie Barkowski, who publishes a blog called Running With Miles. To earn more money, airlines are constantly devaluing this de facto currency, which is \"profitable for the airlines, and costly for the consumer,\" wrote Grayson. Others say that the government has no business regulating airline miles. \" Airlines establish the rules, the terms, the value, expiration dates, and the sales pitches.\" Public opinion on the issue is split. The net effects of these revisions will begin sinking in early next year, just as the government investigation starts to gain momentum. It may be difficult to effect serious changes within the current regulatory system, according to Tim Winship, who edits the Web site FrequentFlier.com.

Warning that a crude-oil train derailment in the densely populated Chicago area could result in \"unthinkable\" devastation, city and suburban officials are calling for stricter rules on hazardous material shipments than the federal government has proposed. \" Aurora Mayor Tom Weisner, co-chair of the suburban coalition, said federal regulators are moving in the right direction, but their efforts \"remain severely compromised by the apparent effort to indulge industry's economic concerns. The officials are calling for the adoption of the toughest of three proposed standards, including thicker shells, electronically controlled pneumatic brakes and rollover protection on tank cars that haul crude oil and other hazardous materials. The concerns and recommendations by local officials appear to be among the strongest of some 2,000 submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to meet a Wednesday deadline. Forty-seven people died and 30 buildings destroyed. An incident in a heavily populated area of the city could potentially impact thousands of people in the immediate vicinity of a hazardous materials release or explosion,\" the city said in documents filed with federal regulators. Chicago-area officials also called on federal regulators to improve notifications for first responders and impose a hazardous material freight fee to defray the cost of training and equipping first responders. Barrington Village President Karen Darch, co-chair of the suburban coalition, believes the proposed rules are too weak and said even one tank car with hazardous materials could pose a public safety risk. \" The association also took issue with the proposal to require electronically controlled pneumatic brakes on tank cars used to move flammable liquids, saying such systems are very costly and not justified in terms of improved safety benefits. In response to proposed new rules governing the growing number of tank car trains hauling crude oil, city and suburban leaders are asking regulators to take additional steps, which they say would make these trains safer and improve the ability of emergency responders to react to spills and derailments.

      " Led by Christopher A. Hart, the acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, the group discussed findings on the probable causes of the accidents, including a derailment that left four commuters dead in the Bronx in December. The safety board had been calling for 12 years for the screening of train operators for sleep disorders, Mr. Hart said, but had been ignored by Metro-North's primary regulator, the Federal Railroad Administration. Three senators and a top federal safety official delivered a blistering critique on Tuesday of the Metro-North Railroad and regulators in Washington for lapses in maintenance and oversight that led to five accidents that killed six people in less than a year. Mr. Hart said the engineer, William Rockefeller, had subsequently received a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that can cause fatigue and drowsiness.

      " The Lac-Mégantic tragedy \"is a case where rules were simply not followed,\" Ms. Raitt said. We have a regulatory obligation to classify that product and make sure it's in the proper area and make sure it's properly marked,\" said Brad Herald, the association's vice president of Western Canada operations and natural gas markets, said in an interview. Studies have found that crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken Shale formation is more volatile than oil from elsewhere. Along with the oil testing, the minister, Ms. Raitt, also issued a directive requiring operators to meet a standardized minimum on the number of hand brakes to be applied to their trains, and to put in place other physical measures to prevent runaway trains. Its report also said Canada's transport regulators failed to properly monitor rail-safety inspections at the regional level. Canada plans to hire engineers and other experts to support inspectors in the field and to extract crude samples at various points in the supply chain for testing. An industry-led effort to study the volatility of shipped oil and the frequency of crude sampling during shipping is also underway, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \" Canada will also conduct an \"audit blitz\" of training requirements for rail companies operating in Canada, including short-line or smaller railroads, Ms. Raitt said. The Canadian measures introduced Wednesday go further than changes currently expected in the U.S., where regulators are set to issue new rules next year. The volatility of Bakken crude, which was involved in the Quebec crash, has emerged as one of the key issues facing regulators as the shipping of crude by rail continues to grow. Transport officials will do more research on how crude oil behaves during shipping and will step up inspection efforts around the classification of oil and other dangerous goods, Canadian Transport Minister Lisa Raitt said. Canada's transportation-safety regulator in August blamed the train operator's \"weak safety culture\" and a host of other factors for the accident. Also, that state is considering new rules compelling producers to make the oil less volatile before shipping it.

      " Based on the magnitude of those charges, LPL felt it was necessary to make a public statement last week. \" The brokerage firm's 13,910-strong adviser force has been expanding more rapidly than some of its competitors. Analysts tried in vain to gauge just how many more regulatory hits the Boston-based firm will take in the coming months. Mr. Casady, however, deflected those questions, saying that he couldn't predict or characterize those possible expenses. He added that LPL has expanded its staffing in legal, risk and compliance functions by more than 40% in the last two years, \"increasing the layers in supervisory and compliance review, particularly around complex products and manual processes.\" Besides that, LPL disclosed in July that it was ordered to pay nearly $3 million in charges by the Illinois Securities Department for not properly maintaining records documenting why its financial advisers switched clients from existing variable annuities into new ones. In response to this increasing regulatory scrutiny, LPL is investing in its technology, as well as its risk-and-compliance measures. The system, which will start rolling out in the spring, will add certain automation elements and be more efficient than the soon-to-be-replaced system, BranchNet, Mr. Arnold said during the interview. LPL had been in discussions with various regulators over \"several different items\" late in the quarter and in early October, said Chief Financial Officer Dan Arnold during an interview with The Wall Street Journal. The firm warned last week that it would have $23 million in regulatory expenses this quarter, dwarfing the $5 million in fines and restitution it had initially forecast. Through the first nine months, LPL has paid $32 million in regulatory charges, roughly twice what it had paid in the past two years. \" They get the investments we're making to help oversee the business. The regulatory items have not had an impact on our recruiting,\" Mr. Arnold said. \" LPL's profit stumble stems from its regulatory woes. LPL's regulatory travails are partly due to its growing pains over the last few years. LPL Financial Holdings Inc.'s regulatory burdens are taking a toll as the brokerage firm reported a nearly 12% drop in third-quarter profit. The new platform, the development of which is being funded through roughly $75 million in overall capital investments across the entire firm, should help it recruit new financial advisers, said Mr. Arnold, adding that the regulatory charges haven't affected those efforts at this time. \" Net income fell to $33.3 million from $37.6 million a year earlier, LPL said Thursday morning when reporting its third-quarter results, against revenue of $1.09 billion, a 3.4% rise from last year. Last year, for example, LPL took one of its biggest regulatory hits after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered the firm to pay $9 million for failing to keep emails and other securities-related documents. But that growth outpaced LPL's technology investments, and the regulatory punches have been rolling since. Subsequent fines have piled up since then, including a $5.3 million charge from the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth last year for violations stemming from the sale of real-estate investment trusts, and another from Finra in March for almost $1 million for the inappropriate sales of several types of alternative investments, such as nontraded REITs. You have to work through them and better understand them and work with the regulators.\" Mr. Arnold declined to go into detail regarding the regulatory charges, but he did say that the fines levied were mostly due to LPL's overall policies, procedures and systems, and not because of specific financial adviser actions. The firm is moving ahead with a new financial adviser platform launch, known as ClientWorks. It's just the nature of them. The most recent quarter saw that head count grow by 70 advisers from the second quarter and by 347 year over year. The root of many of these matters stem from a prior period of rapid growth as the complexity of the business increased and our requisite spent on systems, policies, procedures and staffing were not maintained at an adequate pace,\" said Chief Executive Mark Casady during a conference call with analysts Thursday morning.

      " Carlo Scissura, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, criticized the mayor for imposing the regulations instead of going through the council and holding hearings in which the business community could comment. The law had required employers to pay $11.90 an hour without benefits, or $10.30 an hour with benefits. The order matches the council's intent with the 2012 law, Mr. de Blasio said, and \"we're all on the same page about where this needs to go.\" According to the order, commercial tenants at government-backed projects will now be covered by the living-wage regulations, a controversial component that was rejected as part of the compromise legislation passed in 2012. The order took effect immediately but doesn't apply to projects authorized for a city subsidy before the mayor's signature. Officials expect that the regulations would affect 18,000 jobs over the next five years, compared with 1,200 under the 2012 law. Mr. de Blasio's intention to sign the order was reported Monday night by the New York Times. Mr. de Blasio said he was bypassing the council because this was a \"matter of urgency\" and there are coming development deals that officials want covered by the new regulations. While Mr. Perez and other government officials praised the move, some leading members of the business community predicted the strict regulations could be damaging.

      " Retrofitting the plant for the new coal regs \"was not in the best interests of our customers\" because of the potential rate increase, said Melissa McHenry, AEP's director of external communications. When a company makes a decision like this, it makes a filing that seeks recovery of the costs of investment. \" It's one of the big coal-powered electric plants that must comply with new environmental regulations -- imposed by the Obama administration -- and in 2012, the company announced that it would shut down its coal-burning furnaces, even though it relied on coal that was mined locally. The company instead will shift to electricity generated from a plant in West Virginia that meets the new regulations, which will result in only an 8 percent increase. Earlier this year, Kentucky regulators also approved a plan to convert part of the plant to natural gas, which will be used for peak periods. First, it's unclear why a senator would be seeking to provide scrubbers to an investor-owned company. The Facts First, let's look at the issue with the 50-year-old Big Sandy power plant, which is owned by American Electric Power. Grimes and McConnell have both been critical of the environmental regulations, but her assertion that \"McConnell didn't fight to get the scrubbers it needs to reduce coal emissions\" makes little sense. The company said the reason for the shift is that retrofitting the plant to comply with the new coal regulations, using a scrubber system, would have resulted in a 31 percent increase in electricity rates for eastern Kentucky residents. She said there is nothing that McConnell could have done to help the company get the scrubbers, since it is a state regulatory issue.

      " Before regulators move, though, ICAO and the International Air Transport Association, the main global airline trade group, are working to come up with voluntary recommendations for global tracking. U.S., European and international air-safety authorities appear to be heading in different directions when it comes to requiring real-time tracking of airliners or mandating installation of video recorders in their cockpits. Meanwhile, both Boeing and Inmarsat are working on enhanced systems intended to transmit more extensive data to the ground as often as every 10 seconds if there is an emergency. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, isn't currently drafting rules that would mandate enhanced tracking of planes or putting video devices inside cockpits to help investigators reconstruct the actions of pilots following a dangerous incident or accident. Space-based technology \"can get important data off the aircraft, reliably, even as it is going down,\" said Richard Hayden, an executive with FLYHT Aerospace Solutions Ltd., a Canadian provider of real-time data from aircraft systems. The presumed crash in March of the Boeing Co. 777--which still hasn't been located--also sparked widespread discussion of how to simultaneously transmit or \"stream\" certain aircraft-operating data to the ground if pilots lose control of a plane, major systems fail or some other emergency occurs. The splits, which emerged during a public forum Tuesday by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, suggest that global agreement on standards and regulations affecting such key safety enhancements is likely to be difficult--and most likely will take years. They are expected to focus on technical standards instead of company-specific technologies. Regardless of how regulations evolve, the panelists agreed that none of the projected satellite-transmission solutions are likely to entirely replace actual recorders.

Lawmakers say e-cigarette regulation will be at the top of the agenda. The uncertainty over the safety of e-cigarettes has meant regulation, so far, has been patchy. The United Nations agency also raised concerns about the growing influence of major tobacco companies on the e-cigarette industry, which was initially dominated by companies that didn't sell regular cigarettes or other tobacco products. But as more people have started to use e-cigarettes, regulators have increased their efforts to monitor use of the devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed in April that e-cigarettes be banned to those under 18 years of age and include health warning labels, but final rules are still months or even years away. LONDON--A subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC is in advanced discussions with the U.K.'s health-care authority over a license for an electronic cigarette, marking the latest attempt by Big Tobacco to secure government backing for its products. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control meets in Moscow next week for a conference that takes place every two years.

But at the same time, beefing up vendor security could prove an important way to quarantine an attack. The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an audit of 50 firms to assess their readiness for attacks as well as their relationships with vendors. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is conducting its own broad look at how American brokerage firms and asset management firms deal with assaults from hackers and how they oversee their vendors. Other regulators are examining the preparedness of 500 community banks and credit unions for dealing with an attack. At a dinner in New York on Tuesday evening that included the general counsels from JPMorgan, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank on the guest list, New York State's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, emphasized the gathering danger to the financial system when vendors' security is lax, according to one of the people briefed on the matter.

Susan F. Axelrod, executive vice president of regulatory operations at the financial industry's regulating agency, said financial firms needed to improve their criteria in hiring vendors, continue to monitor the providers for security during the course of a contract and then pay particular attention to what happens when a vendor's work is done. \" Still, in the aftermath of the attack, the issue of data security has gained momentum.

      " The bank continues to serve as a lightning rod for controversy. The company's executives say they can probably find other ways to put that money to work -- and the current investments will continue to be profitable for the next year or two -- but the capital rules will eventually make that much more expensive than it has been. \" Since analysts began downgrading Goldman's stock, the share price has continued to outperform many of its peers'. Even when Goldman Sachs's public reputation was taking a beating, the bank's business acumen and profit remained the envy of Wall Street. Goldman is expected to report higher profit than it did a year ago, but much of the bank's recent success has come from divisions that are expected to shrink as new regulations are phased in. In late September, secret recordings of regulators and bankers surfaced, suggesting that the bank had come under scrutiny from regulators, even after the crisis, for pushing regulatory limits. It thrived during the financial crisis in troubled corners of the financial markets that knocked out some of Goldman's competitors, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Remaining the leaders that they are as the regulatory and capital landscapes evolve is their No. Analysts and some investors say they are concerned that lawmakers may continue to come down harder on the company than on its competitors, most of which are not as reliant on Wall Street activities as Goldman. Dealing with the evolving landscape is likely to be a central challenge for whoever takes over as chief executive for Mr. Blankfein, who is 60, whenever the recurring rounds of speculation about him stepping down come true. But they are also a result of businesses that have been successful even as they shrink because of regulatory pressures. Among Wall Street analysts, the company has been losing its favored position. 1 challenge,\" said Glenn Schorr, a bank analyst with the International Strategy and Investment Group. This sort of trading is facing other challenges caused by the Federal Reserve's bond-buying stimulus programs, which have calmed the market and led to less overall trading. The new regulations hit hardest on the buying and selling of bonds and derivatives -- the fixed-income operations -- which were a big profit driver at many banks. Morgan Stanley was the other free-standing Wall Street bank to survive the crisis. Now the company is facing questions about whether it will be able to maintain its place atop the financial industry in a new era of regulations that hit hardest the very businesses in which Goldman makes the most money. This has hurt revenue at several banks, but it is a particular issue at Goldman because trading has accounted for a majority of Goldman's revenue and profit in recent years. Further signs will come next week, when Goldman and the other big banks report third-quarter results. However, it may be even more valuable in the current environment, given the numerous regulatory and economic changes underfoot.\" Those figures reflect, in part, steady cost-cutting at Goldman. The pullback by other companies left Goldman strong in markets that have attracted the heaviest regulatory scrutiny. Adaptability has always been important for our industry,\" Goldman's chief financial officer, Harvey M.

Government officials now crunch these numbers and, more important, so do travel journalists, bloggers, watchdogs and advocates. The ask must be specific, and spelled out in the regulation itself: Perhaps cities require anonymized origin-destination and time data for every trip (taken or canceled), without information on the rider or passenger, down to some larger geography like Census blocks that would preserve consumer privacy. That's when local governments have the most leverage over Uber -- when they're deciding whether and how to legalize it. Aggregated data about neighborhoods instead of trips wouldn't be truly transparent. When the United States deregulated the airline industry in the late 1970s, it required of private airlines something very similar to what cities should require of these ground-transportation companies today:The federal government stopped prescribing airlines' exact routes and fares but, in addition to continuing to ensure safety, it collected data from the airlines about their routes, schedules, fares, how full the planes are, on-time performance and much more.

More than two dozen states allowed the plans to be renewed, although in some cases for only a year. In California, regulators required individual plans that fell short of the health law to be discontinued by the end of 2013 but allowed those offered by small businesses to continue through 2015.

      " In doing so, it is deferring to architects, elected officials and downtown champions who view the rule, known as Regulation 10, as superfluous at a time of advancement in fire safety technology and -- worse -- as a self-imposed prescription for architectural mediocrity in downtown Los Angeles at the very time that it is trying to strut its stuff for the nation. \" What's more, Chief Terrazas said, current Fire Department procedures would instruct people trapped in a burning building to \"shelter in place\" and not head for the roof. Dozens of Helicopter Pads, Like the One at Left, Dot the Rooftops of the City's Skyscrapers Because of a Regulation That Tall Buildings Had to Have Flat Tops for Helicopters to Help with Evacuation in Case of Fire. Photographs by Monica Almeida/the New York Times) (A17) Los Angeles is the only major city in the United States that had a regulation for flattop buildings. \" The rule change, which took effect immediately, has architects and city leaders dreaming of buildings featuring graceful spires evocative of the Chrysler Building in New York, glistening in the night sky or topped with sky-high parks and gardens. The helipad regulation has hindered L.A. from having an iconic, memorable skyline in a city that desperately needs a stronger urban identity,\" said Brigham Yen, a downtown realtor who writes a blog, DTLA Rising. \" Dropping the Rule has Prompted Visions of a New-Look Skyline with Spires and Sky-High Gardens. ( In all that time, only once has a helicopter been used to pluck people from the top of a building on fire, Los Angeles officials said: Five people were rescued from the top of the 62-story First Interstate Bank Building as it burned on May 4, 1988. \" It was those improvements in technology that prompted the Los Angeles Fire Department to agree to drop Regulation 10, said John N. Vidovich, an assistant chief and fire marshal with the department. That is about to change. The Fire Department agreed last month to drop the regulation, which it had long contended was critical for public safety. It's an example of self-censorship,\" said Michael K. Woo, dean of the College of Environmental Design at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. \" A12); the Catalyst for Dropping the Regulations Is the Planned 73-Story Wilshire Grand Center, a Skyscraper Now Rising Downtown. ( One more stupid rule in Los Angeles,\" said Eric Garcetti, the mayor, in announcing its repeal. Under the new regulations, developers of buildings over 75 feet will be able to do what they want with their roofs, provided they incorporate other firefighting design features: a dedicated high-speed elevator for firefighters, a third stairway for escapes and video systems outside every new elevator. No matter how interesting city life has become out on the streets, the Los Angeles skyline remains an uninspiring procession of flattop buildings, a consequence of a 40-year-old Fire Department regulation that every skyscraper be topped by a helipad to allow for emergency rescues. And those individuals were lifted off the roof by L.A.P.D. helicopters that were already orbiting in the area\" rather than by the Fire Department, said Ralph M. Terrazas, the city's fire chief, in a letter he sent to the City Council explaining the regulation change. To the dreamers who envisioned a new downtown, Regulation 10 represented institutional resistance. \" Just don't look up. Los Angeles has long suffered from outsiders' sneers at its urban credentials, so what has taken place in downtown Los Angeles -- or DTLA, as it is commonly called by those who live there -- has helped chip away at a municipal inferiority complex. The Los Angeles Skyline, Above. Downtown L.A. now has the opportunity to design visually stunning high-rises with spires that will strengthen its position as an urban center.\" A Fire Department commission spent two years studying the policy, Mr. Vidovich said, and reached its conclusion after visiting other cities and reviewing the fire safety measures included in new buildings -- not to mention the skylines of places like New York and Chicago. \" ['fire safety', 'public safety', 'new regulation', 'high speed', 'department regulation', 'regulation change', 'fire safety'] [4, 12, 3, 3, 4] [4, 3] -1.03397341211226 \n",

      " We're having this debate, though, not because net neutrality has become an urgent need of the marketplace. Google itself would become a regulated utility under Title II. Google knows that Title II means regulatory risk for any company that operates telecom infrastructure, which all big Web companies do. Netflix has a singular incentive to use regulation to impose an economic model that requires all users to subsidize the costs of Netflix users. Winston Churchill quipped that the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter. Dumb Internet regulation may be about to prove his point. The second reason is the unique situation of Netflix, which generates a whopping one-third of peak Web traffic and implicitly sets the investment agenda of the downstream consumer broadband industry. Google knows that Title II would cast a pall over broadband investment. Five years ago, Google fought to protect its \"Google Voice\" app from regulation under Title II. Some say Google has been scared into silence in the current debate by memories of the name-calling back in 2010, when Google crafted a net neut compromise with arch villain Verizon that was widely praised except by liberal mau-mau groups. Google, along with just about every big tech company except Netflix, is a member of the Information Technology Industry Council, which filed comments with the FCC calling for \"a light-touch regulatory framework rather than a heavily regulatory common-carriage framework.\" That the FCC, as of Friday afternoon, has resisted any urge to introduce a provocative Title II rulemaking before next week's election in hopes of exciting the Obama \"base\" is a good sign. Stimulated by superficial and badly informed skits put on by HBO's John Oliver and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, millions of public comments have poured into the Federal Communications Commission supporting the imposition of 1930s-style \"Title II\" regulation on the Internet in the name of net neutrality. Nature put Netflix in this position; there's no point in complaining because a company has discovered its self-interest. Add the fact that Google is now a broadband supplier itself through its Google Fiber affiliate, plus has ambitions to be a wireless distributor using high altitude balloons, underutilized TV spectrum and other novel approaches. Credit: By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. Which brings us to the question of the day: Where's Google? Google knows that independent experts like the Brookings Institution's Robert Litan and Georgetown's Anna-Maria Kovac, who actually understand what Title II means, point out that Title II would not actually prevent the \"paid prioritization\" that net neuties claim to fear but would introduce every sort of unintended consequence. But as long as Google and others refuse to state forcefully what they know and understand about how net neut politics is morphing into regulatory overkill, the rest of us will have to worry, in the words of Frank Louthan of the Raymond James brokerage, that \"the ongoing debate over how to ruin the Internet just will not die.\" ['title ii', 'title ii', 'title ii', 'title ii', 'information technology', 'regulatory framework', 'common carriage', 'title ii', 'public comment', 'title ii', 'high altitude', 'title ii', 'title ii'] [2, 5, 3, 8] [2, 5, 3, 8] -0.9842519685039369 \n",

While that program was scheduled to end in mid-October, it was extended until the Postal Regulatory Commission reached Thursday's decision. A spokeswoman for the Postal Service said they are still reviewing the decision and couldn't offer any additional detail at this point. The U.S. Postal Service this week won approval for a two-year grocery delivery test, giving letter carriers permission to continue to deliver totes containing food in the San Francisco area. The Postal Service has already been conducting a grocery delivery trial with Amazon.com Inc. in San Francisco, where it is delivering groceries packed into totes early in the morning. While the USPS had sought approval to earn revenues of up to $50 million during the test, the commission limited it to revenues of less than $10 million, dubbing any waiver \"premature due to the lack of financial data to estimate revenues.\" The Postal Regulatory Commission gave the go-ahead in a filing late Thursday, authorizing \"the market test to proceed in the San Francisco metropolitan area.\" The Postal Service can reapply for the waiver after collecting more financial data, the Postal Regulatory Commission added.

And by urging that the Internet be treated as a regulated utility in the U.S., it has strengthened the hand of the U.N. over the Internet globally. Eli Dourado, a George Mason researcher on Internet governance, summed up the situation in a blog post earlier this year: \"This is the reality of international politics: The U.S. would have a very hard time at the ITU arguing that regulating for neutrality and common carriage is OK, but regulating for security, content and payment is not.\" They want the Internet to become a utility, with regulators setting prices and rules. Silicon Valley's embrace of regulation at home undermines its case against the ITU. So why isn't Silicon Valley protesting? Because leading technology companies have abandoned the position that the Internet must remain unregulated and permissionless--that websites and new technologies should be able to launch without government approval of their function and pricing. In 2012, for example, the browser company Mozilla warned that the Internet \"is just too fundamental to our lives to leave it to governments to decide its fate.\" Mr. McDowell warns that American adoption of net neutrality would make it easier for the ITU to \"allow for a 'sending party pays' construct\" that Internet service providers and network operators \"are battling against together in international regulatory arenas.\" Silicon Valley needs to return to its robust defense of the open, unregulated Internet before it's too late. Robert McDowell, who served on the Federal Communications Communication for several years, made this point in Senate testimony last month: \"Expansion of the government's reach into the operations of the Internet is only providing cover and encouragement to foreign governments, as well as multilateral and intergovernmental institutions, that want to have, as Vladimir Putin said, 'international control of the Internet.' \" ['open internet', 'common carriage', 'new technology', 'service provider', 'foreign government'] [11, 3] [11, 3] -0.8021390374331552 \n",

The plan released Friday--endorsed by the Federal Aviation Administration and an advisory group featuring prominent airline representatives--caps years of on-again, off-again efforts by both sides to agree on initial priorities and anticipated benefits. But the report notes that it is the industry's responsibility to equip \"enough aircraft to realize operational benefits\" and to promote data-link services \"across as many aircraft as feasible.\" ['air traffic', 'computer technology', 'safety analysis'] [8, 3] [8, 3] -0.6060606060606061 \n",

      " Cheh's updated legislation would require the app-based services to provide primary insurance coverage \"of at least $1 million per occurrence for accidents\" from the time a driver accepts a call until the passenger exits the car. For her part, Cheh said the legislation offered just the right amount of regulation. The D.C. Council and the D.C. Taxicab Commission have sparred over how best to regulate the new services. At a committee mark-up session Wednesday, Councilmember Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) said he had concerns that the legislation -- co-sponsored by Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) -- did not do enough to level the playing field between app-dispatched services such as uberX and Lyft and taxicabs. The D.C. Council held a six-hour hearing on the matter in May, but the issue was put on hold until this fall. This post has been updated. The legislation would give D.C. cabs the opportunity to vary their rates provided they are booked through an electronic app. Since the services began operating, a series of incidents across the country have raised questions among regulators and some members of the public about insurance coverage and whether drivers are being properly screened and trained. Popular app-based ride services such as UberX, Lyft and Sidecar would face new regulations under updated legislation laid out by D.C. Council member Mary Cheh at a hearing Wednesday. Vehicles used by services such as uberX, Lyft and Sidecar would also be required to undergo yearly inspections. The commission, for example, sought to limit the number of hours that drivers using their personal vehicles to give rides could drive. The services, in which individuals use their personal vehicles to give rides, have built a loyal following among customers since they began operating in the region but have raised the ire of cabdrivers and other vehicle-for-hire services, which say the app-based operators have an unfair advantage because they don't have to follow the same rules.

      " The Charlotte, N.C., lender's agreement with Philadelphia Energy Solutions is the most high-profile bank oil deal since U.S. regulators began pressuring banks last year to reduce their presence in markets for physical raw materials. Last week, the bank closed on a transaction to sell some of those assets to Swiss trading house Mercuria Energy Group. Bank of America will provide services primarily involving credit guarantees and short-term financing. The bank's revenue in the deal comes from financing fees; while such an arrangement has lower margins than the supply and trading structure it had under J.P. Morgan, it would also require much lower personnel and other overhead costs, according to people familiar with the terms. Under pressure from regulators, J.P. Morgan said last year that it was selling its physical commodity franchise and exiting the business. Bank of America Corp. has agreed to provide financing for a top U.S. oil refinery, taking over an oil-services contract that was among the commodity assets divested this year by J.P.

      " So being first up for recreational makes logical sense.\" One study by EcoNorthwest for initiative proponents projects that the state's recreational marijuana could sell for $145 an ounce, much lower than prices charged in Washington recreational stores. \" The initiative also faces ambivalence, and even outright hostility, from some of those who make their living from marijuana. It's definitely buzzing out there. Proponents are hoping to build on the momentum created by successful legalization initiatives approved in 2012 in Washington and Colorado. We definitely learned the need to implement an effective tax rate that brings marijuana out of the criminal market into the regulated market,\" said Anthony Johnson, an Oregon attorney who is the initiative's chief petitioner. Some growers worry that legalization will result in costly new regulations and open the door to big corporate players who will dominate the markets. \" The expansion of Oregon medical marijuana providers into recreational sales would be a different path than that taken in Washington, where there is a separation between regulated pot shops open to all adults and a much bigger medical marijuana trade with scant government oversight. In Oregon, the wording of the 35-page ballot measure assures that there would be plenty of other differences from the legalization of marijuana in Washington: * The Oregon initiative would allow people to grow up to four plants in their homes, a practice prohibited under Washington's marijuana law.

      " The FAA would not comment for this story. The costs of the proposed change are not justified by the potential benefits,\" the FAA wrote on Dec. 30, 1999, with no explanation. More than nine years later, after an unusually long period to act on a proposed regulation, the FAA reversed itself, saying it agreed with critics and withdrew the measure. \" The FAA appears not to recognize the risks associated with post-impact fires or the potential to mitigate those risks,\" the Canadian board wrote last year. If the regulation had been adopted in 1993, it would affect about 40,000 of the 200,000 private airplanes now in use. And the fires seriously burned at least 309 people who survived, often with permanent scars after painful surgery. Fires have been killing and maiming pilots and passengers since the 1920s but, after triggering some attention in the 1980s and early 1990s, have been largely ignored by federal regulators and crash investigators. While most of the roughly 2,800 post-crash fires since 1993 began after hard landings or crashes, hundreds began after milder impacts, federal records show. The costs, projected at between $556 and $5,710 for each newly made airplane, were deemed too high compared with the dollar value of the lives that would be saved. Benefits were calculated by quantifying items such as health and safety improvements that would result from a regulatory change and placing a dollar value on the improvements. The $1 million figure was crucial because the less money each life was worth, the easier it was for companies and critics to show that costs would exceed benefits. Spilled fuel is easily ignited by engine heat or exhaust, sparks and electrical components. Federal agencies were required under a 1981 executive order to propose major regulations only when \"the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society.\" The Australian Civil Aviation Authority, responding to the FAA proposal, did its own calculation of the cost of the fuel systems and said it would be three to five times as much as the benefit. The FAA's reluctance to strengthen fuel systems contrasts with fire-prevention action taken by its sister Department of Transportation agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates automobile safety. In 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed requiring new small airplanes to have equipment and designs that would prevent such fires and save up to 20 lives a year. The FAA's $1 million figure was \"the minimum statistical value used in government regulatory analysis,\" the FAA acknowledged in its 1990 proposal. NHTSA since 1968 has mandated that cars and trucks leak no more than 1 ounce of fuel per minute after a rear-end crash at 30 mph. The FAA, like other agencies proposing new regulations, placed a dollar value on each human life, but selected a value that it acknowledged was low: $1 million.

      " The proposals will now be discussed by the Telecom Commission, a panel of Indian officials within the federal telecommunications department that decides on policy issues. Auctions won't be held for the 900-megahertz band in four service areas, and in two service areas for the 1800-megahertz band as frequencies aren't available in those areas, the regulator said. NEW DELHI--India's telecommunications regulator on Wednesday proposed the starting prices for a coming auction of frequencies to cellphone companies whose permits are set to expire later this year. India's federal government expects to raise 454.71 billion rupees from sale of frequencies during the current fiscal year through March 2015. The telecommunications regulator has also asked the government to put up for auction frequencies that allow operators to offer high-speed third-generation and fourth-generation telecommunications services on cellphones and tablet computers, before the current set of proposals are finalized. India is divided into 22 telecommunications service areas based on population and the business viability of providing cellphone services. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India suggested that the Department of Telecommunications auction frequencies in the 900-megahertz band with a starting price of 30.04 billion rupees ($489 million) per unit and in the 1800-megahertz band at 21.38 billion rupees ($348 million).

      " If you're a Solyndra you get $536 million in Department of Energy loan guarantees, but if you're a General Motors bondholder, you're bullied into watching the auto unions get paid off ahead of you. Today politicians, regulators and bureaucrats wield enormous power and direct wealth and fame to their favored subjects. Imagine the cost savings if regulators worried about real safety hazards and truly corrupt business arrangements rather than effecting social change through EPA and presidential dikta. And as Mr. Galston says, the next presidential candidate will have to focus on jobs and the economy, and I'd add that he or she should remember that we Americans have dreams too. We must simply go on a rampage to eliminate regulations and modify surviving regulations to be more business friendly. The solution is easy, and it is not more taxes, bigger government and higher government debt. Although the solution is simple, it won't happen. Meanwhile their expenses skyrocket, such as gas prices, college tuition, state and local taxes and health-care costs, when not subsidized by the government. This granting of rewards to cronies takes many forms such as employment, direct government contracts, legislation, appropriations, tax loopholes, political appointments, regulatory burdens on enemies, acceding to lobbyists' requests and the special investigation and harassment of enemies. Anna Rollinger St. Johns, Fla. --- Mr. Galston fails to recognize the most important shift in the economy over the last 50 years -- the move from free-market-based capitalism with light regulation to crony capitalism with heavy regulation. Taxes could be lowered, capital would efficiently flow into projects yielding positive returns and employment would expand with higher wages as the real economy grew. In the past most success went to entrepreneurs and businesspeople who took calculated risks in innovation and increased demand by satisfying the public's wants faster, cheaper and more conveniently.

      " The commission this month announced the potential deregulation of fixed-line markets, enabling national regulators to remove limits on the prices telecom companies can charge other operators for network access. Regulation has previously been largely focused on keeping costs low for consumers. But Europe is lagging well behind when it comes to investing in digital infrastructure. That already assumes a more favorable regulatory environment. There are signs of movement. As a result, Ebitda margins among European telecom companies averaged 28% in 2013, compared with 33% for U.S. peers. Take 4G connections, which accounted for 3% of European Union mobile connections against 27% for the U.S. at the end of 2013, according to GSMA, an industry body. And consolidation alone may not spur much-needed spending, a prerequisite for growth in the sector. Next would be to make it worthwhile for mobile operators to build high-speed networks by allowing room for prices, and therefore earnings, to rise. Regulators are waking up to Europe's telecom dreams when they should already be out of bed. With a new European Commission starting business next month, its members will need to address the issues in an industry with more than 100 fixed and mobile providers operating in 28 jurisdictions. Hopes for consolidation have boosted the sector in the past two years, with major European telecom operators valued at about 5.6 times 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization--in line with peers globally. One key consideration is the extent to which operators will be required to share their fiber-optic and 4G networks, and what they can charge for that. While consolidation may help meet the costs of network upgrades, companies also need regulatory clarity to better predict their likely return on capital.

Weiner noted that their research into T-cells within the body's immune system -- some of which fight off infection and others that act to regulate other cells -- could help develop treatments for both MS and brain tumors. In patients with brain tumors, the tumor sends signals that create more regulatory cells, which then suppress the ability of the immune system to fight the tumor. \" They developed an antibody that marks those regulatory cells, giving researchers a better sense of how a patient is responding to treatment. That's actually what we found.\" In a patient with MS, Weiner said, researchers believe there may be a defect in the regulatory cells that causes the immune system to be overactive.
